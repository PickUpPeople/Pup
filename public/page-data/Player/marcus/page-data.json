I mean, the prospect of dunking?! My other memory is a chunky pair of New Balance James Worthy hi-tops with the puffiest tongue I’ve ever seen, still to this day. This was the latter years of what I now know were the Showtime lakers; Magic Johnson and James Worthy, not mention Michael Jordan and Larry Bird – the gravity and fame of these dudes was enough to reach even me in suburban Perth, Western Australia, the most isolated city on earth. </p><p>I guess the playground is where pick up begins in its most basic form; you make up teams with other kids and you run. I was lucky enough to grow up with a twin brother so games of one on one were regular after school activity, in our driveway or at a local ring. </p><p>Influence wise, our local teams were the Wanneroo Wolves (regional) and the mighty Perth Wildcats. Cal Bruton, Trevor Torrence, Tiny Pinder, James Crawford. Ricky Grace. It’s an odd thing to admit and reflect on, but at this young age I remember wanting to be black and American. I was listening to a lot of Public Enemy and NWA. A ten year old wearing giant clocks on a chain – just ridiculous. But the athleticism and grace of the Wildcat players seemed on another level. Basketball was a lunchtime staple throughout high school, and continued after school with my brother, though most everything took a bit of a back seat to the ocean once I discovered surfing. </p><p>I played intermittently over the next 10 years or so, and it wasn’t until 2004 or 2005 when a then stranger asked me offhandedly if I played ball, and wanted to fill in for their local team that Monday night. The White Fucking Rhinos. And soon enough I was once again immersed in the world of hoops. I started following the NBA and my childhood team, the Lakers, again. Monday night games became regular. Regular shoot arounds and pick up games would ensue at Miami High as the last of the golden light dropped to twilight. </p><p>Sydney was really where pick up really PICKED UP for me though, when I moved in 2013. I knew some people and had some existing friends, but only a couple that played ball. </p><p>Since then I’ve made so many great friends and community networks through about half a dozen pick up runs scattered over Sydney. Cranbrook School on Monday nights. Early ATP and Camperdown runs on Monday and Wednesday nights. Moore Park and Prince Alfred Park. </p><p>KGV on Saturdays and Sundays has been a great experience, watching regular players change and grow over that time. The crowd is ever changing, but with a consistent crew of regulars as well. It definitely feels like a place where different people can come to gather or find space for themselves; an escape from the rest of the world in a way. </p><p>Then Terrigal for the last couple of years – the Sunday Tezza scrimmage. Such an incredible mix of old and young, and varied backgrounds. Above all everyone is made to feel welcome, and respect (often amongst fierce competition) is upheld above all. Again I’ve gained great friends, joined a local team for a period. It’s another great hub for the community; a place for people to meet and compete in a sport they love. </p>"},"type":"Player","title":{"text":"Marcus"},"image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.8333333333333334,"src":"/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/d5471/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/00e5e/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 200w,\n/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/1a903/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 400w,\n/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/d5471/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"marcus"}}}
