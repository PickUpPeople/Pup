Playing pick-up or just ball in general has allowed me to cross people of many different backgrounds and at the same time create friendships through this.</p><p>My first memory of ball was in my cousin’s backyard growing up. I remember particularly that I hated losing; I was just like, damn this! The love of the game grew from there and from that moment onwards it was always a push to constantly get better.</p><p>I was seven when I left my native Philippines – migrating to Australia – where I grew up mainly on Sydney’s North Shore. This was the era of watching Jordan, Magic, Ewing – pretty much 1990s ball. My parents then wanted to retire up on the Central Coast so we moved up in my final year of high school.</p><p>The era I grew up in was based on defence – you took pride in shutting a person down. The game back then was so physical. Even growing up I remember it being a physical game and particularly in the Phillipines. You may hate each other on court, but ball usually brings people altogether for a feed, a drink and a laugh too. I think communication on the court is oddly my biggest strength. I’m a pretty quiet person off the court, so it’s pretty much a split personality.</p><p>These days when rep ball is in offseason I play pick-up mainly at Terrigal on Sundays, or sometimes I’ll travel down to Sydney for a change of pace. </p>"},"type":"Player","title":{"text":"Marcus"},"image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.8333333333333334,"src":"/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/867d5/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/471e9/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 200w,\n/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/dc2cb/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 400w,\n/static/dbe3026b2f09eb2ec4c4f2ea4faced80/867d5/6200dcfa-2856-42cf-a3a2-c1b5719e0c9c_MARCUS.jpg 700w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"marcus"}}}
